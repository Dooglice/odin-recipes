    <h2>A delectable smorgasbord </h2>
    <h3> Featuring purring and blind stalking</h3>
    <p>The squeak is a modern twist on the venerable classic cat. We enjoy the time tested feline flavoring with a bit of blindness thrown in for good measure. The Squeak comes to us all the way from the animal shelter and is a close relative of the similar Smoosh dish. Warming up just in time for the fall season, be sure to stock up on all the ingredients before the prices rise for seasonal adjusment.</p>

<p>While you may have had other cats in the past, rest assured none will compare to the silliness and cuteness overload we will have in the face of this creature. Will leave you wanting to clone her!</p>
